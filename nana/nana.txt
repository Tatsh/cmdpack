Nana                                                              version 1.3

Introduction
------------

Nana is a generic viewer for uncompressed graphics in various formats,
similar in style to Louis Bontes' Naga, but geared towards viewing rather
than editing.  Currently Nana supports the tile formats used on the NES,
SNES, and Genesis, as well as a variety of raw formats.


Usage
-----

The command line syntax is:

    NANA filename

Where "filename" is the file you want to view.  You will be brought to a
screen displaying the contents of the file starting from the top, in the
default format (8 bits per pixel / raw).  The address for each line is shown
on the left, in hexadecimal.


Keys
----

   Up            Scroll up in the file by eight lines
   Down          Scroll down in the file by eight lines
   Shift+Up      Scroll up in the file by one line
   Shift+Down    Scroll down in the file by one line
   Page Up       Scroll up in the file by one page
   Page Down     Scroll down in the file by one page
   Home          Scroll to the top of the file
   End           Scroll to the bottom of the file
   Shift+Home    Set the starting offset to zero
   Shift+End     Set the starting offset to the last byte in the file
   Left          Decrease the starting offset by eight columns
   Right         Increase the starting offset by eight columns
   Shift+Left    Decrease the starting offset by one column
   Shift+Right   Increase the starting offset by one column
   - (minus)     Decrease the starting offset by one byte
   + (plus)      Increase the starting offset by one byte
   , (comma)     Decrease the width by one column
   . (period)    Increase the width by one column
   <             Decrease the width by eight pixels
   >             Increase the width by eight pixels

   t             Toggle between "raw" and "tile" mode.

   1 thru 6      Change the format.  The formats are currently:
                 (Tile mode)
                 1....... 8x8, 1 bit per pixel
                 2....... 8x8, 2 bits per pixel, SNES format
                 3....... 8x8, 2 bits per pixel, NES format
                 4....... 8x8, 4 bits per pixel, SNES format
                 5....... 8x8, 4 bits per pixel, Genesis format
                 6....... 8x8, one byte per pixel
                 7....... 8x8, 8 bits per pixel, SNES format
                 (Raw mode)
                 1....... 1 bit per pixel
                 2....... 2 bits per pixel, highest-first
                 3....... 2 bits per pixel, lowest-first
                 4....... 4 bits per pixel, highest-first
                 5....... 4 bits per pixel, lowest-first
                 6....... one byte per pixel

   ESC           Quit


How to build from source
------------------------

The source code to Nana is available here: http://www.neillcorlett.com/nana/

DOS/DJGPP version:

    make -f djgpp.mak

    To build the full standalone EXE, you'll need PMODSTUB.EXE installed in
    your DJGPP\BIN directory.  The makefile assumes this is in Y:\DJGPP\BIN.
    It also assumes you have UPX installed.

Win32/SDL version:

    Use the included Nana.sln in Visual Studio 2005.  SDL libraries and
    headers must already be set up in Visual Studio's paths.  See
    http://www.libsdl.org/ under Download - Development Libraries - Win32.

* Allow much larger widths to be selected.
* Fixed the address display for files bigger than 16 MiB.
* Fixed a possible crash when switching between tile and raw mode.

v1.2:
